# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize H1-2019 ride sharing data between Rural, Urban and Suburban cities including
- Number of rides
- Number of drivers
- Total fares
- Average fare per ride and driver
- Trends of fares collected over time

## Results
The following table summarizes the ride sharing data between city types:

As expected, the increased population density from rural to urban area leads to higher amounts of rides and drivers. This also could explain the high per ride and per driver fare due to longer distances traveled between destinations.

The following figure shows the trend of fares between January through April 2019:

The differences between total fares generally appears to track together.  Overall trend in fares appears to go up from January to April.

## Summary
Based on the data collected, the following actions are recommended to address the disparities between city types:
- Further analysis to determine nature of trips from and to rural areas, including call-to-pickup response times
- Provide incentives to encourage suburban drivers to be available for rural fares
- Provide incentives to encourage urban drivers to be available for suburuban and rural fares
